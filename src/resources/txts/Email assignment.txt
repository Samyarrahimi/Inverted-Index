Subject : Postponing the project deadline

Dear Dr.Yousefi

Due to recent pandemic we can not work together in university, We will continue our project remotely and it might take some time to prepare the environment to work remotely.

As project manager, i would like to ask you, whether is it possible to postpone the deadline of the project?

Best regards

Samyar Rahimi
